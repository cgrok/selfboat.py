# What is *Selfboat.py?*

***Selfboat.py*** is a personal boat inspired by *Selfbot.tk*
and improved by **cgrok** members with much love ❤

Just like your trousers...

Take it with you everywhere you go. *~~However, don't take them out in public~~*
 
## Features

- All commands respond in plain text (with the ocacional markdown) and raw images. Bye bye to all the nice embeds and colorthief...

- Any relevant or important output is printed in a single ERROR-CHANNEL that's created automatically after a successful install.

- By default the prefix is `//`, though you can change it. Just be smart and don't use `selfbot.`, `self.`, or `s.`. And stay clear of triggering ones such as: `!`, `?`, `@`, `#`, `>`, `]`, `}`, `-`, `=`, `+`, and `$`, because they'll trigger every single bot in that server, and call unnecesary attention.

- **`//help`** is also gone. To access a list of all commands, be sure you are in ERROR-CHANNEL, and that you use `//c`.

- **Youtube** is there, and it gives you the top match for your search, or edits invoking message.

- All errors EDIT invoking command with a random quote, or joke. If you're in a Guild that logs message edits, then they will show your prefix. [default one is `//` and the invoking command name]

## Do I *really* need this?

- First of all, there's nothing wrong with the self-bots that are out there, in fact, they are much better and more equipped than this particular one. The need for this version came about on the event that even though Self-bots aren't against Discord's ToS, still, some Mods don't like them and they can/will ban anybody with one.

- Besides Mods banning regular self-bot users giving that as the only reason, there are also moderation bots that can ban users who print embeds in their own messages, as embeds and custom presence status are only allowed for bot-accounts.

- As it currently is, discord.py library doesn't handle message Headers correctly for anything other than bot-accounts, and Discorod API doesn't like these Headers in their DMs, so they *will* flag or disable your account if you use any regular self-bot in private messages. This is not the case with ***Selfboat.py***.

- Another issue is the excessive use of Embeds for most self-bot responses. These go against Discord API, in the same way that BetterDiscord's embeds and other fishy plugins are.

- And lastly, some of the moderation command have little or no value to anybody who isn't a Mod.

This is why we saw the need of a much lighter, cleaner, and stealthy *boat* that could keep us afloat. And thus **Selfboat.py** was born, the same day discord.py went _kaboom_. *Sniff sniff*

## Installation guide:

Okay, after reading all that boring stuff, you still want your personal ***Selfboat.py***

Just follow these simple steps. It is written mainly for installation using a PC/laptop, however, we do include phone guide inside [notes] in case they differ.

### What the heck is Heroku?

Heroku is a free cloud system platform that allows you to run ***Selfboat.py*** 24/7 totally Gratis!

### Is ***Selfboat.py*** capable to be run locally from my PC/laptop/phone?

No. It requires a fast connection and particular Config Vars from Heroku. Usual computer ping is around `280.00ms`, whereas usual Heroku ping goes around `14.00ms`. That's even faster than Google cloud's average of `88.00ms` and other VPS that go anywhere from `80.00ms` to `260.00ms`.*
